        <h3>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>

        </p>

        <p>
          We use personal information collected via our App for a variety of

          indicate the specific processing grounds we rely on next to each
          purpose listed below.

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</b> If we receive

            <b>For other business purposes.</b> We may use your information for

            trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns
            and to evaluate and improve our App, products, marketing and your
            experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and
            anonymised form so that it is not associated with individual end
            users and does not include personal information. We will not use
            identifiable personal information without your consent.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          The information collected is not shared with anyone outside of our

        <p>
          We may process or share your data that we hold based on the following
          legal basis:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Legal Obligations:</b> We may disclose your information where we
            are legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable
            law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order, or
            legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena
            (including in response to public authorities to meet national

          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Vital Interests:</b> We may disclose your information where we

            and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are
            involved.
            <ul>
              <li>
                More specifically, we may need to process your data or share

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries
          other than your own.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our servers are located in the UK. If you are accessing our App from
          outside, please be aware that your information may be transferred to,
          stored, and processed by us in our facilities and by those third
          parties with whom we may share your personal information (see{" "}
          <u>&quot;Will your information be shared with anyone?&quot;</u>{" "}
          above), in and other countries.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are a resident in the European Economic Area, then these
          countries may not necessarily have data protection laws or other
          similar laws as comprehensive as those in your country. We will
          however take all necessary measures to protect your personal
          information in accordance with this privacy notice and applicable law.
        </p>

        <h3>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you
          share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated
          with, our Website.
        </p>

        <p>
          The App may contain advertisements from third parties that are not
          affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online
          services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and
          privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected
          by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not
          responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and
          policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or
          applications that may be linked to or from the App. You should review
          the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to
          respond to your questions.
        </p>

        <h3>6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the
          purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by
          law.
        </p>

        <p>
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
          necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
          longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
          accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice
          will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90
          days.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
          personal information, we will either delete or anonymise such
          information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
          personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
          securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
          further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>

        <h3>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          We aim to protect your personal information through a system of
          organisational and technical security measures.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security
          measures designed to protect the security of any personal information
          we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your
          information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or
          information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so
          we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
          unauthorised third parties will not be able to defeat our security,
          and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,
          transmission of personal information to and from our App is at your
          own risk. You should only access the App within a secure environment.
        </p>

        <h3>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>

        <p>
          <b>
            <i>In Short:</i>
          </b>{" "}
          You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we
          are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
          right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.

        <h3>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>

        <p>
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
          applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or
          setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have
          data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
          this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and
          implementing DNT signals has been finalised. As such, we do not
          currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
          automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a
          standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
          future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
          this privacy notice.
        </p>

        <h3>11. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>

          Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with
          relevant laws.

        <p>
          We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated
          version will be indicated by an updated &quot;Revised&quot; date and
          the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If
          we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you
          either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly
          sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy
          notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your
